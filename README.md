Work sample from the early development stages of a server to provide project management services.
The system is tailored to a client's existing processes. Their specific use case involves a high project turnover rate
and a need to quickly validate project status and progress. To this end I worked to come up with a set of checklists that
standardize their general workflows and ensure project quality. These checklists are tracked per project, update in real time
along with the rest of the system, and include a permissions system and general management interface as well as tooling to
enable management to create new checklists and evolve the system over time without requiring additional programming changes.
